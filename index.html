          Adventure Time is an American fantasy animated television series
          created by Pendleton Ward and co-produced by Frederator Studios for
          Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn
          (Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John
          DiMaggio)â€”a dog with the power to change size and shape at will. Finn
          and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact
          with Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny),
          Marceline (Olivia Olson), BMO (Niki Yang), and others. The series is
          based on a 2007 short film that aired on Nicktoons. After the short
          became a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeon's executives passed on
          its option before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series
          from Fred Seibert and Ward, which was previewed on March 11, 2010. The
          same year, the series premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, and it
          ended its eight-year run on September 3, 2018.

          Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase,
          which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride slowly. The design,
          coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend
          forward more, making use of stronger muscles (particularly the gluteus
          maximus) and reducing air resistance at high speed.

        </div>
        <p class="para">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
          harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing
          shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
          entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of
          the air flowing over the outside.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="para">
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

        </div>
        <p class="para">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="para">
          Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up
          paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major
          differences including the board design and length, the riding style
          and the kind of wave that is ridden.
